Here's a few important resources:

project.  Includes guides, roadmaps, and more. *(outdated as of 2021)*

join if you're interested in contributing!

# Coding conventions
Check out our current code in ```master``` to get a feel for what we're looking for.  We optimize for readability.
 + Please adequately describe the variable, function, or class in a way where it's immediately understandable what it is
 or what it does.
 + Use spacing to divide different logical parts of functions or behavior.  This greatly helps with readability!
 + For any sufficiently complicated piece of code, please include dosctrings inside of the object, to better explain
 what it does.
 + standard_python_naming is what's used for naming variables and functions.
 
More may be added if anything arises.  Feel free to make a suggestion if you think I'm missing anything important! 
Thanks!
